🚖 Ola Cab Booking System – SQL Project
📌 Project Overview

This SQL-based project simulates a real-world Ola Cab Booking System by managing and analyzing data related to customers, drivers, cab bookings, trips, and payments.
The project demonstrates how relational databases are used to support cab service operations and business analysis.

🎯 Objectives

Design a structured relational database for a cab booking platform

Manage customer and driver information efficiently

Track ride bookings, trip status, and payment details

Perform analytical SQL queries for business insights

📊 Business Questions

How many total rides have been completed successfully?

Which drivers have completed the highest number of rides?

Which customers are the most frequent riders?

What is the total revenue generated from completed rides?

Which pickup locations are most frequently used?

What is the average trip fare per ride?

How many rides were cancelled by customers or drivers?

Which time period has the highest number of bookings?

Which drivers generate the highest revenue?

What is the overall booking success rate?

🗄️ Database Structure

The database consists of the following tables:

Customers

Drivers

Cabs

Bookings

Trips

Payments

Locations

Each table is connected using primary keys and foreign keys to maintain data integrity.

🛠 SQL Concepts Used

CREATE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

SELECT queries with WHERE, ORDER BY

GROUP BY and HAVING

INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN

Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG)

Constraints (Primary Key, Foreign Key)

Subqueries

📈 Key Insights

Peak booking hours show higher demand for cab services

A small group of drivers completes a large percentage of rides

Certain locations contribute significantly to overall revenue

Frequent customers play a major role in total booking

🛠 Tools Used

MySQL / PostgreSQL

SQL Workbench / pgAdmin

📂 Dataset Description

Customer details (ID, name, contact)

Driver details (experience, availability)

Booking status and trip records

Payment and fare information

🧠 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to design and analyze a real-world cab booking system. It highlights the importance of database relationships, query optimization, and data-driven decision-making in transportation platforms.
